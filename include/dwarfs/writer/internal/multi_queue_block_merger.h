/**
 * Deterministically merge blocks from multiple sources into a single stream.
 *
 * This class implements a block merger that deterministically merges blocks
 * from multiple sources into a single stream. The order of the sources is
 * fixed and the order of the blocks within each source is preserved.
 * The number of active slots determines how many sources can be merged
 * simultaneously. The number of queued blocks determines the overall number
 * of blocks that can be queued for merging before the merger blocks.
 *
 * You'd typically set the number of active slots to the number of threads
 * that are used to produce blocks. While it is possible to use more threads
 * than active slots, this will not improve performance and will only increase
 * the memory footprint. However, it is not possible to use less threads than
 * active slots, as this will cause the merger to ultimately block all threads
 * and deadlock, since it is assuming that another thread will eventually add
 * more blocks.
 *
 * The order of the blocks in the output stream is only determined by the order
 * of the sources and the number of active slots. The number of queued blocks
 * only has an effect on the efficiency of the merger. Being able to queue more
 * blocks means that the merger will block less often, but it also means that
 * more memory is used.
 *
 * It is vital that the blocks passed via add() are generated in the correct
 * order as specified by the sources vector.
 *
 * The callback is called for each merged block while the merger's internal
 * mutex is locked. This means that the callback should not block for a long
 * time. The callback is called from the thread that calls the add() method.
 *
 * The merged_block_holder class is used to hold a merged block. As long as
 * the holder is alive, the held block will count towards the number of
 * queued blocks. Once the holder is destroyed, the held block will be
 * released and the number of queued blocks will be decremented.
 *
 * It is also possible to provide a policy that returns the size of a block
 * as well as the worst case size for a block from a certain source. This
 * can be useful to keep an upper bound on the memory usage of the merger.
 * It is even possible to only partially release a block, e.g. after the
 * block has been compressed.
 *
 * TODO: The lifetime of block holders should be extended to before adding
 *       a block to the merger. This would allow the merger to block even
 *       before a block is added (which already consumes resources at that
 *       point). It would also allow blocks to change size while being
 *       processed by the merger.
